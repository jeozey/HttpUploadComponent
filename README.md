# HttpUploadComponent
Xmpp ExternalComponent For File Upload


The HttpUploadComponent is a plugin extension to your XMPP server that allows users to upload files to a HTTP host and eventually share the link to those files.

It runs as a stand alone process on the same host as your XMPP server and connects to that server using the Jabber Component Protocol.

A detailed introduction into the necessity of such a component and the simple protocol can be found in XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload.
